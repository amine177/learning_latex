% Example 1
\ldots when Einstein introduced his formula
\begin{equation}
  e = m \cdot c^2 \; ,
\end{equation}
wich is the most beautiful thing on comsmology.

\ldots from which follows Kirchoff's current law:
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{k=1}^{n} I_k = 0 \;
\end{equation}

Kirchoff's voltage law can be derived \ldots

\ldots which has several advantages.

\begin{equation}
  I_D = I_F - I_R
\end{equation}
is the core of a very different transistor mode. \ldots
